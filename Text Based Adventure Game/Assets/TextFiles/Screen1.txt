You awake. Inspecting the souless subway carriage, you realise you must have dozed off on the way back from class. A bright "OUT OF SERVICE" light is flashing slowly but despite this, train seems to be moving at a high speed. 

You notice a small peice of paper placed on the seat opposite, it looks like a note!

What should I do?
1. Read the Note.
2. Try find someone.
